### OSU CS-427 Capstone Project

A Breakout (Atari game) clone with ML-agent.

Using Unity / C#, we learned to create a game with looping music, sound effects, score tracker, and (pause) menu. An ML-agent was trained to play the game so that players could play against a computer opponent.

The controls are straight forward as the paddle follows the mouse cursor. Simply click the start the game, and if at any time you'd like to pause, hit ESC.
